# RemitFlow Frontend

RemitFlow is a cross-border remittance app powered by the Stellar network.
This repository contains the React + Vite frontend.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs at http://localhost:5173 by default.

## Features

- **Home** — landing page describing the product.
- **Send Money** — enter a recipient and amount, pick currencies, and see a
  live FX quote with the RemitFlow fee broken out before sending.
- **Transfers** — list of your transfers with status badges (pending,
  completed, failed), search/status/date-range filters synced to the URL,
  plus loading, error and empty states.
- **Tabs** — reusable tabbed interface with swipe gesture support for mobile, accessible keyboard navigation, and controlled/uncontrolled modes.
- **Print support** — a dedicated print stylesheet (`src/print.css`)
  optimises the Transfers dashboard and other pages for printing: hides
  navigation chrome, interactive elements, and applies a light background
  with readable text and preserved chart/status colours.
- **Dark mode toggle** — switch between Dark and Light visual themes with session persistence saved in `localStorage` under `remitflow:theme`.
- **Mock wallet** — connect a demo Stellar wallet (no network calls).
  - Robust error handling for rejected connections
  - Connection timeout protection (30 seconds)
  - Clear error feedback to users
  - Automatic error state clearing on retry or disconnect

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + Vite
- React Router for navigation
- Plain CSS with theme tokens (no UI framework)
- A mock Stellar SDK / wallet and a mock backend API (no network)

## Project Structure

```
src/
  components/   reusable UI (Navbar, Sidebar, Footer, QuoteCard, TransferRow, ...)
  pages/        route screens (Home, SendMoney, Transfers, NotFound)
  services/     mock api, wallet, fx and quote logic
  hooks/        useWallet, useTransfers
  context/      AppContext (wallet state)
  utils/        format and validation helpers
  constants/    currencies and fee config
```

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to override the (unused in mock mode) API base URL:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build
- `npm test` — run the automated Vitest suite
- `npm run test:watch` — watch mode for local test development
- `npm run format` — format all source files with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` — check formatting without modifying files (CI)
- `npm run lighthouse` — run Lighthouse CI against the local preview server

## Responsive Layout

The app adapts seamlessly across screen viewports:

| Range      | Target                   | Layout                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| >1024px    | Desktop                  | Full sidebar (240px), 3-column features grid                                                                        |
| 721–1024px | Tablet landscape         | Full sidebar with toggle, 2-column features grid, compact content padding                                           |
| ≤720px     | Tablet portrait / mobile | Collapsed sidebar (60px), 2-column stacked transfer rows, vertical filter controls, horizontal chart scroll wrapper |
| ≤480px     | Small mobile             | Single-column transfer rows, full-width filter controls, stacked hero actions                                       |

The Sidebar is rendered alongside the main content area on all viewports wider than
720px and collapses automatically at narrower widths. All dashboard filters and controls adhere to touch target guidelines.

## Testing

The test suite includes comprehensive coverage of wallet connection handling:

- **Wallet Service Tests** (`test/services/wallet.test.js`)
  - Successful connection flow
  - User rejection handling
  - Storage persistence
  - Disconnection cleanup

- **AppContext Wallet Tests** (`test/unit/AppContext.wallet.test.jsx`)
  - Connection state management
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Timeout protection
  - State restoration from localStorage

- **WalletButton Tests** (`test/components/WalletButton.test.jsx`)
  - UI feedback for connection states
  - Error message display
  - Retry behavior
  - User interaction flows

Integration tests cover send-money validation, successful transfer submission,
pending button behavior, duplicate-submission prevention, Transfers page
filter sync (search, status, and date-range presets such as last 7/30/90 days),
and landscape tablet layout integration.

### Transfer recovery storage

Before submitting, Send Money must read the session operation journal and save
the safe recovery reference successfully. Unavailable storage, malformed JSON
or a journal that is not an object map prevents that attempt from reaching the
transfer API; existing stored bytes are left untouched. The form reports that
the attempt was not submitted and permits a retry after storage recovers.

Only the opaque fingerprint, idempotency key, status and transfer reference are
stored. The same in-memory intent is retained after a failed pre-submit save.
Status updates after submission and mount-time recovery remain best-effort, so
a late journal failure cannot hide an accepted transfer. The existing demo API
still requires its separate localStorage record to be saved before reporting
creation. Session recovery does not replace a production backend idempotency
store or provide cross-tab or live-provider guarantees.

The following captures show the built local-demo app under a controlled journal
write failure (2026-10-03). The earlier version accepted the transfer without a
recovery reference; the repaired version explains that this attempt was not
submitted. Restoring storage permits one successful retry and receipt recovery.

| Viewport width | Earlier accepted state                                                  | Repaired refusal                                                         |

## Accessibility

All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, selects, icon buttons, and
checkboxes) meet a minimum touch target of 44×44 CSS pixels, compliant with
WCAG 2.5.5 (Target Size). A dedicated test suite in `test/touch-targets.test.js`
audits the CSS declarations to ensure compliance isn't regressed.

### Form Validation & Screen Reader Announcements

Form components (`TextField`, `CurrencySelect`, `SendMoney`) follow WCAG accessibility best practices for error announcements:

- **ARIA invalid states**: Inputs set `aria-invalid="true"` when validation fails and `aria-invalid="false"` when valid.
- **Accessible descriptions**: Input controls link to error message elements using `aria-describedby`.
- **Live region alerts**: Error messages render with `role="alert"`, `aria-live="assertive"`, and `aria-atomic="true"` so screen readers immediately announce validation feedback.
- **Form submission failure feedback**: When form submission fails validation, an assertive live region summary announces the errors, and keyboard focus automatically shifts to the first invalid field.

## Tabs Component

The `Tabs` component supports both controlled and uncontrolled modes:

```jsx
<Tabs
  tabs={[
    { label: 'Send', content: <SendForm /> },
    { label: 'History', content: <TransferHistory /> },
  ]}
  activeIndex={0} // omit for uncontrolled
  onChange={(i) => {}} // called on tab switch
/>
```

- **Swipe gestures**: On touch devices, swipe left/right to switch between tabs (50px threshold).
- **Accessibility**: Uses ARIA `tablist`, `tab`, and `tabpanel` roles with proper `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-labelledby` relationships.
- **Keyboard**: Active tab is focusable via `tabIndex`. Tab headers are `<button>` elements.

## Notched / Rounded Devices

The app supports notched and rounded-screen devices (e.g. iPhone X+,
Android flagships) via CSS `env(safe-area-inset-*)`:

- CSS custom properties are defined in `src/index.css` (`--safe-area-inset-top`,
  `--safe-area-inset-bottom`, `--safe-area-inset-left`,
  `--safe-area-inset-right`) with a `0px` fallback.
- The `<meta name="viewport">` tag already includes `viewport-fit=cover`.
- Layout components (`Navbar`, `Footer`, `Sidebar`, `Modal`) consume the
  custom properties to keep content clear of notches, rounded corners and the
  home indicator.
- The `useSafeAreaInsets` hook (in `src/hooks/useSafeAreaInsets.js`) exposes
  the numeric pixel values for any component that needs them in JavaScript.

## Lighthouse CI

Lighthouse checks are configured in [lighthouserc.json](lighthouserc.json) and run in GitHub Actions on pull requests to the main branch. To validate locally, build the app and run:

```bash
npm run build
npm run lighthouse
```
